	// The remaining billing cycles in the current term.
	RemainingBillingCycles *int `json:"remaining_billing_cycles,omitempty"`

	// If `auto_renew=true`, when a term completes, `total_billing_cycles` takes this value as the length of subsequent terms. Defaults to the plan's `total_billing_cycles`.
	RenewalBillingCycles *int `json:"renewal_billing_cycles,omitempty"`

	// Whether the subscription renews at the end of its term.
	AutoRenew *bool `json:"auto_renew,omitempty"`

	// If present, this sets the date the subscription's next billing period will start (`current_period_ends_at`). This can be used to align the subscriptionâ€™s billing to a specific day of the month. For a subscription in a trial period, this will change when the trial expires. This parameter is useful for postponement of a subscription to change its billing date without proration.
	NextBillDate *time.Time `json:"next_bill_date,omitempty"`

	RevenueScheduleType *string `json:"revenue_schedule_type,omitempty"`

	// Specify custom notes to add or override Terms and Conditions. Custom notes will stay with a subscription on all renewals.

	// For manual invoicing, this identifies the PO number associated with the subscription.
	PoNumber *string `json:"po_number,omitempty"`

	// Integer paired with `Net Terms Type` and representing the number
	// of days past the current date (for `net` Net Terms Type) or days after
	// the last day of the current month (for `eom` Net Terms Type) that the
	// invoice will become past due. For `manual` collection method, an additional 24 hours is
	// added to ensure the customer has the entire last day to make payment before
	// becoming past due. For example:
	// If an invoice is due `net 0`, it is due 'On Receipt' and will become past due 24 hours after it's created.
	// If an invoice is due `net 30`, it will become past due at 31 days exactly.
	// If an invoice is due `eom 30`, it will become past due 31 days from the last day of the current month.
	// For `automatic` collection method, the additional 24 hours is not added. For example, On-Receipt is due immediately, and `net 30` will become due exactly 30 days from invoice generation, at which point Recurly will attempt collection.
	// When `eom` Net Terms Type is passed, the value for `Net Terms` is restricted to `0, 15, 30, 45, 60, or 90`.
	// For more information on how net terms work with `manual` collection visit our docs page (https://docs.recurly.com/docs/manual-payments#section-collection-terms)
	// or visit (https://docs.recurly.com/docs/automatic-invoicing-terms#section-collection-terms) for information about net terms using `automatic` collection.
	NetTerms *int `json:"net_terms,omitempty"`

	// Optionally supplied string that may be either `net` or `eom` (end-of-month).
	// When `net`, an invoice becomes past due the specified number of `Net Terms` days from the current date.
	// When `eom` an invoice becomes past due the specified number of `Net Terms` days from the last day of the current month.
	NetTermsType *string `json:"net_terms_type,omitempty"`

	// Subscription shipping details
	Shipping *SubscriptionShippingUpdate `json:"shipping,omitempty"`

	// The `billing_info_id` is the value that represents a specific billing info for an end customer. When `billing_info_id` is used to assign billing info to the subscription, all future billing events for the subscription will bill to the specified billing info. `billing_info_id` can ONLY be used for sites utilizing the Wallet feature.
